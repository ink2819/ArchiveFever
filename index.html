    <h1>Archive Fever</h1>
    <p><strong>Group Exhibition Presented by <a href="https://accentaccent.com/">Accent Sisters</a></strong><br>
        Curated by Yanbin Zhao<br>

                <p>Accent Sisters is pleased to present <em>Archive Fever</em>, a group exhibition featuring works that
                    engage, diversify, and challenge the notion of archive. <br><br>
                    Taking its title from Jacques Derrida’s <em>Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression</em>, this group
                    exhibition considers the archive not as a static repository of the past but as an active, unstable
                    site of power, memory, and desire. From traditional archives—bound up with authority and
                    hierarchical structures—to modern counter-archives that reframe narratives and subvert these
                    structures, Archive Fever explores what is remembered, what is effaced, and the tension between
                    preservation and erasure.<br><br>
                    The participating artists engage archives as material and
                    metaphor—deconstructing and reassembling them to produce spectral effects that unsettle dominant
                    narratives and open new pathways into racial, political, cultural, colonial, geographical, and
                    spiritual imaginaries.</p>

                <p>46 × 24 inches<br>Archival inkjet prints, letterpress</p>
                <p><em>Autopsies</em> draws from a single 1870 photograph of Chinese boys trafficked from California to
                    New England to serve as strikebreakers in a shoe factory. Departing from this image, Tsubota
                    searches the archive for an imagined boy who could have—but never did—appear there, opening pathways
                    into intertwined histories of race, photography, labor, and extraction. Using archival and original
                    images, sculptural works, and fictional text, the project meditates on relationships between
                    personal and collective histories, bodily and visual archives, and the unstable space between image
                    and narrative.</p>

                <p>Single-channel video installation (color, sound); cast sugar cane sculptures<br>11:30 minutes</p>
                <p><em>Passages II</em> considers oceanic thinking as a connective force linking intertwined histories
                    of exploitation and resistance across the Pacific and Caribbean. Combining digital and archival
                    footage, cyanotypes on 16mm, and excerpts from Japanese, Caribbean, and Pacific literary traditions,
                    the project reflects on the artist’s great-grandparents’ history as Japanese laborers on Hawaiian
                    sugar plantations. The work situates these islands within broader imperial histories while
                    highlighting their shared legacies of resistance and solidarity. Following Epeli Hauʻofa’s reframing
                    of Oceania as “a sea of islands,” the piece envisions the ocean as a site of ancestral history,
                    resilience, and futurity.</p>

                <p>Beginning in LED factories in southern China, <em>Look On the Bright Side</em> traces the geological
                    timescales embedded in contemporary digital illumination. Interweaving factory footage with recycled
                    social media videos, the film portrays communities shaped by—and suspended within—an environment of
                    perpetual light. Its nonlinear narrative reveals networks of technological, industrial, and human
                    bodies, exploring how fragile organic life persists amid a culture obsessed with brightness,
                    transparency, and efficiency.</p>

                <p>Shanzhai Lyric is a research-based art project exploring the radical poetics of experimental English
                    found on counterfeit (“shanzhai”) T-shirts. Through an expanding archive of “poetry-garments,” the
                    project examines mistranslation, linguistic malfunction, and hybrid expression as forms of
                    world-breaking and world-making that subvert global hierarchies. The work embraces nonsense,
                    permutation, and technological aberration as speculative methods for imagining alternative
                    linguistic and cultural futures.</p>

                <p>This series transforms a 1910 <em>London Magazine</em> article titled <em>Chinese in England, A
                        Growing National Problem</em>, one of the earliest portrayals of Liverpool’s Chinese community
                    in popular media. By meticulously erasing explicitly racist descriptions and retaining fragmentary
                    language, Yang assembles an alternative narrative that references the mass deportations of Chinese
                    residents in the 1940s. The work intervenes in a discriminatory archive, reframing erasure as an act
                    of reclamation.</p>

                <p><em>Fair Use</em> investigates the political implications of copyright restrictions on archival
                    images—particularly newsreel footage inaccessible to the very communities represented within them.
                    <em>Fair Use I</em> reworks a 30-second newsreel about Lee Kyung Soo, a Korean War orphan adopted by
                    a U.S. naval officer, using frame-by-frame erasure and rotoscoping. Kim employs fair use principles
                    as transformative critique, questioning who owns historical images and who has the right to
                    interpret them.</p>

                <p>Kang’s work emerges from a year-long engagement with her grandmother’s archive—poems, drawings,
                    photographs, and recollections tied to the Korean War. Through reconstructed timelines and personal
                    testimony, the artist weaves together histories of occupation, Western intervention, and
                    intergenerational trauma. Waegwan’s hills, populated by “Korean ghosts, American ghosts,” become a
                    site where memories collapse and converge. By tracing her Halmoni’s bittersweet accounts, Kang
                    reflects on familial silence, national division, and the enduring specters of war.</p>

                    the Arizona Queer Archives, contemporary art periodicals, pop-internet culture, and the artists’

                    transforming them. In dialogue with Derrida, the work examines the tension between preservation and
                    erasure and the compulsion to save what is already vanishing.</p>

                <p>Interactive Installation; crowd-sourced human hair; LED panel; labels; containers; mixed media</p>
                <p>Rooted in data feminism and speculative design, <em>Matrilineal Hair Archive</em> invites
                    participants to contribute shed hair along with a trait they associate with their maternal line.
                    These contributions form a living counter-archive of embodiment, memory, and care. Hair—carrying
                    mitochondrial DNA and personal history—becomes material evidence of presence, labor, and lineage.
                    Inspired by the artist’s memories of finding her mother’s hair throughout their home, the project
                    reimagines archival practice as relational and affective, challenging institutional hierarchies that
                    determine whose bodies and data are preserved.</p>

                <p>Borich’s project emerges from the Mary Wright Plummer Papers, engaging with how words become
                    meaningful through relationships. By mining transcribed notes, poems, correspondence, and archival
                    images, the artist reflects on how particular phrases resonate because of who shared them or held
                    them close. The work proposes that the archive is not only a repository of documents but a network
                    of interpersonal attachments that give language its emotional weight.</p>

                <p>Two-channel sound installation<br>30 minutes</p>
                <p><em>I heard…</em> layers a repeated spoken phrase—“I heard”—with a filtered PBS NewsHour broadcast
                    reporting political crises, conflict, and global instability. Engaging Derrida’s concept of “archive
                    fever,” the work treats sound as an unstable archive: fractured by static, distortion, and
                    miscommunication. The installation highlights slippage between hearing and remembering, proposing
                    that the archive is less a fixed record than a restless pulse shaped by absence, noise, and desire.

                <p>The project takes its title from a Communist-era phrase celebrating self-sacrifice and ideological
                    fulfillment. Peng visualizes an ongoing monologue between generations shaped by the Chinese Cultural
                    Revolution, drawing from rehabilitated photographs and documents to reveal how historical narratives
                    exert influence across time. The work reflects on the impossibility of reciprocal dialogue between
                    past and present, creating an infinite “single-sided conversation” that exposes the continuity of
                    ideological control across eras.</p>
